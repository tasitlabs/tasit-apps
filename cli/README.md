# Tasit CLI

This folder is the eventual home for the Tasit CLI. For now, we're buliding out the scaffolding of our first app in the [`demo` directory](../demo). The CLI will use the repeatable parts of the scaffolding there to autogenerate a bare bones mobile Ethereum dapp or a more fully featured one, for example one prebuilt specifically for NFT dapps. There's more info in the [main README for this repo](../README.md)
